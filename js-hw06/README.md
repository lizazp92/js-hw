I think it's starting to sink in.
I rewrote the dog exercise from the object HW and made it as a list of objects and the result was much better.
I feel lost operating the multiple synonims coming from function and callback function arguments, variable names..like, specificFaculty, facultyFind, facultySpecific UGHHHHHH I hate it.
