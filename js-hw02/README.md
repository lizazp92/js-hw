Regarding the 5th task:

I thought I would need to put a min/max value to date/month. then add conditions (but how do I make them running in circle? that after December(12) it's again January(01)?) but my partner was like "why aren't you using built in Date, it will be easier".
It was not easier. I still don't understand why I needed to put Date(year, month, date); - in this specific order (in brackets) otherwise it would break.
